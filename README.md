# 🚀 Agent-30: Building Production-Level AI Agents

> **A 40-Day Challenge to Master AI Agent Engineering**
> From first principles to scalable, monetizable AI products.

---

## 📖 Overview

**Agent-30** is an intensive, structured roadmap designed to transform developers into **Advanced AI Engineers**. Unlike simple tutorials that show you how to call an API, this project focuses on the **engineering, architecture, and productization** of autonomous systems.

Over the course of 40 days, this repository will evolve from simple scripts into a **multi-tenant, knowledge-aware, production-grade AI platform**.

## 🗺️ The Roadmap

### [Phase 1: Core Agent Engineering (Days 1–10)](./Phase%201%20%E2%80%94%20Core%20Agent%20Engineering/phase1.md)
> **"Build the Brain"**

We start by building AI agents from **first principles**—no heavy frameworks, just raw logic and understanding.
- **Focus:** Deterministic reasoning, tool calling, memory management, and prompt engineering.
- **Key Outcome:** A robust, model-agnostic agent runtime built from scratch.
- **Tech:** Node.js, Gemini API, File-based Memory.

### [Phase 2: Framework-Based & Multi-Agent Systems (Days 11–20)](./Phase%202%20%E2%80%94%20Framework-Based%20&%20Multi-Agent%20Systems/phase2.md)
> **"Orchestrate the Team"**

Transitioning to **LangGraph** to build reliable, state-driven multi-agent workflows.
- **Focus:** Graph-based execution, human-in-the-loop, persistent checkpoints, and multi-agent collaboration (Planner + Executor + Critic).
- **Key Outcome:** A scalable orchestration layer for complex tasks.
- **Tech:** LangGraph, LangChain, State Machines.

### [Phase 3: Advanced AI Systems (Days 21–30)](./PHASE%203%20%E2%80%94%20Advanced%20AI%20Systems/phase3.md)
> **"Unlock the Knowledge"**

Giving agents access to deep knowledge through **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** and Vector Databases.
- **Focus:** Embeddings, semantic search, vector stores, and grounding responses in truth to prevent hallucinations.
- **Key Outcome:** Intelligent agents that can "read" and reason over vast datasets.
- **Tech:** Qdrant (Vector DB), Embeddings, RAG Pipelines.

### [Phase 4: Productization & Monetization (Days 31–40)](./Phase%204%20%E2%80%94%20Productization%20&%20Monetization/phase4.md)
> **"Ship the Business"**

Turning the code into a viable **SaaS Product**.
- **Focus:** Multi-tenancy, API design, security, usage tracking, billing/monetization, and Docker deployment.
- **Key Outcome:** A fully deployed, revenue-ready AI agent platform.
- **Tech:** Docker, API Gateways, Stripe (Conceptual), Auth.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

This project is built on a modern, scalable stack:

- **Runtime:** Node.js (TypeScript/JavaScript)
- **Intelligence:** Google Gemini Models (1.5 Flash / Pro)
- **Orchestration:** LangGraph & LangChain
- **Memory/Knowledge:** Qdrant Vector Database
- **Infrastructure:** Docker & Cloud Deployment

---

## 🎯 Final Goal

By the end of this challenge, the goal is not just to have "code that runs," but to possess the **mental models and engineering discipline** required to build the next generation of AI startups and enterprise tools.

> *"The difference between a script and a product is reliability, scalability, and usability."*
